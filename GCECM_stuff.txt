MANAGER: Runs on all servers involved in the replication. It is the master process which controls all GG activity.
EXTRACT: Runs on the source database server. It extracts data from the Oracle database either directly or indirectly in the case of Integrated capture.
DATAPUMP: Runs on the source database server. It is an optional process which transmits extracted data from the source database server to the target database server. (Optional because the EXTRACT process can do this directly).

SERVER COLLECTOR: Runs on the target database server. Receives extracted data from source database server and stages it in the local trail files on the target database server for the REPLICAT process to apply it to the target database.
REPLICAT: Runs on the target database server. Reads extracted data from the local trail file on the target database server and applies the data to the target database.

Attached is a cheat sheet for patching the GCECM databases.  We can talk about this if you have questions on it.  I took out some things that weren’t related to GCECM.

Attached is a cheat sheet I used for upgrading to 12c several years ago – not sure how helpful this will be.  There is some stuff in here not relevant to GCECM.

Delana Banks supports the FEP, DOCIDX, and EDIPROD databases.  Those databases, along with GCECM, are used by the FEP application.  It’s good to patch/upgrade all 4 at the same time, if possible, so the application people don’t have to test on any more weekends than necessary.  This can’t always be accomplished.
