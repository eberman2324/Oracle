Do not schedule the backup cleanup script when dropping the existing database (reply N to the prompt).
   The cleanup script can be run manually after the 30 day period is up

Hi Rich,

It’s been 30 days since we cloned HEPYTST/HEDWTST.  What is process to manually run cleanup scripts ?

Thanks.

Execute the cleanup_rman_tsm.sh script.  
 You will need to zopa the DBNAME and DB_ID to be cleaned.  
 The DB_ID is available in the log produced in the $LOGS directory by the drop_database.sh or by looking in rman.


rmanc

list incarnation of database HEPYTST;


or

cd $SCRIPTS

cd ..

cd logs

ls -altr drop*

view xxxx

cd $SCRIPTS
cleanup_rman_tsm.sh HEPYTST 969049231
