The issues yesterday with some of the datamart/datarep batch were due to the change in the ORACLE_HOME path following the Oracle patches Wednesday.  Basically there are many legacy scripts here and several different places where the ORACLE_HOME path is hard-coded.  We worked through identifying and changing these yesterday.
 There are a couple of things we can do to make sure we don’t have the issue for the next Oracle patches.

The first thing is to document the locations where we had to change the path today.
Specifically, places where the environment variable ORACLE_HOME is set needed to be changed from the old ORACLE_HOME path to the new ORACLE_HOME path. 
The files we found that needed to be changed were:
datamart
/dm/bin/dm_functions_2.sh
/dm /bin/dm_functions.sh
/dm /bin/shell_lib_2.sh
/dm /bin/shell_lib.sh
/home/s036100/.profile
/home/dmadm/.profile (note: we didn’t actually change it here, but the old reference is here so we probably should)

datarep
/dr/bin/sh_lib.sh
/dr/bin/shell_lib_2.sh
/dr/bin/drwkab/zeke_exe.ksh
/dr/bin/drwkab/zeke_exe_lpymt.ksh
/usr/local/profile/oracle.profile

If we do nothing else, then we know that ADA needs to change the ORACLE_HOME path in at least these places the next time we patch Oracle.
 If we want to go further, though, the hard-coded reference to the path should be changed to use either the Oracle-supplied /usr/local/bin/oraenv script or
a custom script that picks up the ORACLE_HOME path information from the /etc/oratab file.
