Inspect trace file that was generated by following job: 
This job should be scheduled from crontab

load_hang_analyze.ksh




What:
====
1) Dowload script from Doc ID 438755.1 and create function version_rpt.
-- High SQL Version Counts - Script to determine reason(s) ( Doc ID 438755.1 )

sqlplus / as sysdba
@version_rpt3_25.sql

2) Generate a version report for SQL_ID: sql_id_???

conn / as sysdba
set pages 2000 lines 100
SELECT * FROM TABLE(version_rpt('sql_id_???'));

4) Check version report section Versions Summary to see if it contains ROLL_INVALID_MISMATCH.

4) If ROLL_INVALID_MISMATCH is present in the version report then change your gather_table_stats call to include no_invalidate=>true for table MEMBERSHIP. If ROLL_INVALID_MISMATCH is not present in the version report then take no action.

Continue to run the wait_and_dump script and monitor for re-occurrence of contention on "library cache lock".
