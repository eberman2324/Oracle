Please follow the below guidelines for changing your password.

Oracle "Strong Password" Guidelines:

New passwords: 
	must have a minimum of 8 characters 
	must NOT contain the users account name 
	must contain at least one lower case character 
	must contain at least one upper case character 
	must contain at least one numeric character 
	must contain at least one punctuation type character  [ie:  ),!,?,#,(,$,%,?,+,* ]
	must be different from the previous password by at least 3 characters 

Accounts will be locked upon 5 consecutive failed logon attempts.
   (Accounts will stay locked for 5 minutes after that time.) 

Passwords will expire after 90 days.  

The grace period is set to 10 days.  This specifies the number of days AFTER the 
grace period BEGINS during which a warning is issued and login is allowed.  
If the password is not changed during the grace period, the password expires. 

Password reuse time is set to 390 days. This specifies the number of days 
before which a password cannot be reused. 

Password reuse max value is set to 24.  This specifies the number of password changes 
required before the current password can be reused.
(These last 2 settings work in conjunction with each other.  A user can reuse the password 
     after 390 days if the password has already been changed 24 times. )

WARNING:  ALL logon attempts are audited in both non-production and production environments.

Please do not share your password with anyone! 


Thank You.
