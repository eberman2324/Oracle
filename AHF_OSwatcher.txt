I think we need to move the datadump path to /oraosw from /oragrid/app/base.    It will have to be done as root.

Rich mentioed to ask Sagun to run this command: tfactl set repositorydir /oraosw/oracle.ahf/data/repository/suptools/xhepydbw2as/oswbb/grid/archive
(Sagun will need to precreate these dirs)
/oraosw/oracle.ahf/data/repository/suptools/xhepydbw2as/oswbb/grid/archive

-->> E.B. Opened SR with oracle and they recommend pretty much install and install back
