1) Run tuning advisor on a sql statement that currently has a sql_profile.  sql_profile is ignored by advisor.  tuning advisor recommends new sql_profile.
2) Disable the sql_profile currently being used by the sql
3) enable new sql_profile
4) sql_profile in step 2 is dropped by Oracle
therefore, before step 2, pack the profile into a table owned by you
in case you need it back
