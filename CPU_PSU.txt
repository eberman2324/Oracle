Metalink Notes: 854428.1 and 850471.1


****************************************************************

With the October 2009 Security Patch there is a new PSU (Patch Set Update) option of applying a unified patch for CPU and recommended patches.
 I took a quick look at the option for the PeopleSoft 11.1.0.7 upgrade. For others that may be considering using PSUs, here are my findings:

o Patch Set Updates (PSUs) are proactive cumulative patches containing recommended bug fixes that are released on a regular and predictable schedule. 
o PSUs are issued on the same quarterly schedule as Critical Patch Updates (CPU) and include CPU patches.
o Either PSU or CPU can be applied for security patches
o PSU is available for 10.2.0.4 and 11.1.07 and 10.2.0.5 for Grid Control
o PSU replaces the Patch bundle concept (such as for RAC, DG, and DB generic bundles) and recommended patch lists.
o Once the PSU option is chosen, it would require a significant effort to revert back to applying CPUs and is not advised (refer to section 7 of doc 854428.1).
o A PSU will be issued at the same time as each CPU.
o A newer version opatch is required to apply the PSU
o There is a new opatch option that allows a check for PSU patch conflicts prior to applying the patch.
o There is a new method for requesting merge patches for patches that conflict with a PSU
o A PSU is applied in its entirety or not at all, however with a CPU individual molecules can be applied or omitted if there are conflicts
o Oracle associates a version number to the patch. The fifth number of the database version is incremented for each PSU. For example 11.1.0.7.1.

As this is a new Oracle option, it is expected that new issues will arise and need to be worked through. Since PSUs are the vehicle Oracle will use to release new recommended patches,
 applying PSUs will become common practice. 
For PeopleSoft we have chosen to go forward by applying the Oct 2009 CPU and not the Oct 2009 PSU due to the differences mentioned above and
that we already have CPUs and Recommended Bundles applied to the installed software that are included in this PSU.
