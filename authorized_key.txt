I got these instructions from someone else, but they should work.

The use of ssh (as a command) can effectively replace both the rlogin and rsh commands. 
You can "ssh host" and it will work very similar to rlogin host. 
You can also "ssh host command" and it will work very similar to rsh host command.  It does this without using your .rhosts file.
 One currently annoying thing is that it will constantly prompt you for your password after you do the ssh.  
It will also prompt you (yes or no) the first time you ssh to a node to authenticate a fingerprint. 
I can't help you with the initial yes/no prompt, but can assist you in setting up an "authorized_key" file so that it will no longer prompt
you for your password.

Here's the steps to set up an "authorized_key" file:

1)  login to a node with your id.
2)  Be sure your home directory is NOT writable by group or other.  You can   chmod go-w $HOME   to be sure. ( you sould be ok here)
3)  execute the following command:	ssh-keygen -t rsa
	At the next 2 prompts, just hit enter (to accept the defaults).  DO NOT ENTER A PASSPHRASE!
4)  execute the following commands:
		chmod go-w $HOME/.ssh	
		cd .ssh 		
		cp id_rsa.pub authorized_keys
		chmod 600 authorized_keys
		cd $HOME

That's it!  Remember, the first time you go to a new host, you will have to enter yes to set up the initial fingerprint. 
Occassionally a host name changes it's purpose (e.g. re-use a db node for transform environment and it will get a different ip-address), 
and you will get an error such as:

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that the RSA host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is
bf:fe:bb:b8:6e:fe:a7:6a:12:09:f4:ca:ae:ac:3b:40.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /u/a512730/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending key in /u/a512730/.ssh/known_hosts:83
RSA host key for node30 has changed and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.

This is no big deal.  All you have to do is edit the $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts file with your favorite editor (e.g. vi) and 
locate the line for the offending node, delete the line and save the file.  Then you can ssh and set up a new fingerprint for the host.
