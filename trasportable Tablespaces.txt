Hi All,

 
Is it possible to restore a database from Linux to AIX?

 
Source OS: Linux 2.6.32-431.20.3.el6.x86_64

Target OS : AIX 6.1

 
Db version:11.2.0.4





user13664377, Looking at RMAN DUPLICATE/RESTORE/RECOVER Mixed Platform Support (Doc ID 1079563.1) it does not appear that AIX to Linux is supported.  
AIX is big endian while Intel use little endian byte encoding. 
 For same endianess the following note should be of interest: Cross-Platform Database Migration (across same endian) using RMAN Transportable Database (Doc ID 1401921.1)

I would think that the transportable tablespace option would support this migration (export/import of metadata, OS file copies, and rman endian conversion).
