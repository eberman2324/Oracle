hello,
there is no nothing called ASM file system.ASM is a method for storing data and it doesnot use file system it uses the concept of raw devices.
To install ASM i recommend doing the following:
1-Install database software only.
2-configure the raw devices using linux raw devices method or oracle utlity asmLib tool.
3-run dbca and install ASM.
4-Run dbca again and install The database.
Please refer to:

****** On call case study********

1. Got page/alert

DEDBAOracle p s Pls cal mission control 860 636 9854 Tony XORACLDM1P RCAT PROD Tablespace CXTPROD is 100 percent full

Basically this is RCATPROD  database one of it tablespace reach max space. Need to extand.

2. Get Oracle password from eDMZ for XORACLDM1P


3. Login to box either first login to boraw1d and then ssh oracle@XORACLDM1P

                   or

                   use RCATPROD_and_GRIDPROD_xoracldm1p.hep - Shortcut 


4. Determine current file location, name and size

 .$SETUPENV RCATPROD

sqlplus / as sysdba
--Get desire file name first
select file_name from dba_data_files order by 1;

5. .$SETUPENV ASM

--login with asmcmd utility to find current datafile size
asmcmd

ls
cd +DATA/rcatprod/datafile

--find file size in bytes
ls -ls


6. .$SETUPENV RCATPROD


sqlplus / as sysdba

ALTER DATABASE DATAFILE '+DATA/rcatprod/datafile/cxtprod.297.814049911' AUTOEXTEND ON MAXSIZE 700M;

ALTER DATABASE DATAFILE '+DATA/rcatprod/datafile/cxtprod.297.814049911' RESIZE 700M;

exit
