Mikes response/action

Looks like this was due to gathering stats on a new table that came in in December release.  There’s a bug associated with this that was supposed to be fixed in 11.2.0.3, but perhaps not…

Bug 10198126  ORA-600 [15160] / ORA-600 [kkoipt:invalid aptyp] / dump [kkogbro] from DBMS_STATS on IOT

Anyway – what I did for now was to lock stats on the table just so that the DBMS_STATS job would skip this table.  I’ll open a case with Oracle to see if there’s a fix out there for it.
exec dbms_stats.lock_table_stats(ownname=>'WKAB10', tabname=>'T_ALERT_NOTIF_QUEUE');

So hopefully these errors should stop now.
