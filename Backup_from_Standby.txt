To do this,  we need to connect to the standby with sys password credentials (not internal) .   We could update the change change sys password job to update a stored oem credential that would be specified in your OEM backup job.
Of course the backups will be in the Windsor data domain so recoveries would be slower unless we have storman do the fast copy thing which would take time as well.
Given the number of times weâ€™ve had to recover prod from an rman backup, I believe this is all doable.

Do we not also need to connect to the primary to switch the current log?  I seem to recall you saying something about this in the past.

No, as long as the connection to the standby is made with a password credential,  oracle will perform the log switch on the primary

  e.g.

  Backup the database from the standby server
 Restore the primary database using the backup taken on the standby server
  Switchover to the standby and take a backup from the new standby server
  Clone using a backup taken on the standby server

  Feel free to add whatever else I may have missed.
