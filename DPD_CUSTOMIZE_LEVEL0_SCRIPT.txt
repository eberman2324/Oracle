Eugene, I did some testing and found the following may work best for our environment.  An additional archive log
backup has been added to ease the effort of restoring through different database incarnations.
 
 
run
{
 CONFIGURE CONTROLFILE AUTOBACKUP OFF;
 BACKUP CHECK LOGICAL DATABASE TAG=BACKUP_DPDEVUG PLUS ARCHIVELOG DELETE INPUT
 TAG=BACKUP_DPDEVUG_ARC;
 BACKUP FILESPERSET 20
 FORMAT '/u10/oraback/DPDEVUG/rman_backups/arc_df%t_s%s_s%p'
 SKIP INACCESSIBLE
 ARCHIVELOG ALL
 DELETE INPUT
 TAG=BACKUP_DPDEVUG_ARC;
 DELETE NOPROMPT OBSOLETE;
 BACKUP CURRENT CONTROLFILE TAG=BACKUP_DPDEVUG_CTL;
 CONFIGURE CONTROLFILE AUTOBACKUP ON;
}
