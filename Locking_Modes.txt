Modes of Locking

Oracle uses two modes of locking in a multiuser database:
***Exclusive lock ***** mode prevents the associates resource from being shared.
This lock mode is obtained to modify data. The first transaction to lock a resource exclusively is the only transaction that
can alter the resource until the exclusive lock is released. 

***Share lock ***** mode allows the associated resource to be shared, depending on the operations involved.
Multiple users reading data can share the data, holding share locks to prevent concurrent access by a writer 
(who needs an exclusive lock). Several transactions can acquire share locks on the same resource.
